# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Analysis in Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Emergency Room (ER) data** using Power BI to uncover insights related to **patient wait times, satisfaction scores, and departmental efficiency**. The goal is to improve hospital operations by identifying trends and areas for optimization.

## 📊 Key Dashboards & Insights
### 1️⃣ **ER Patient Flow & Wait Time Analysis**  
- Identifies peak **admission hours and wait times**.  
- Highlights **busiest periods** for better staffing decisions.

### 2️⃣ **Wait Time by Department**  
- Compares **average wait times across different ER departments**.  
- Helps pinpoint **departments with long delays**.

### 3️⃣ **Satisfaction Score vs. Wait Time (Scatter Plot)**  
- Shows the **impact of long wait times on patient satisfaction**.  
- Helps identify **departments with service quality issues**.

### 4️⃣ **Satisfaction Score Variation by Department (Box Plot Alternative)**  
- Visualizes **distribution of patient satisfaction per department**.  
- Reveals inconsistencies in patient experience.

### 5️⃣ **Overall Satisfaction Score (Gauge Chart)**  
- Provides a **high-level view of patient satisfaction trends**.  
- Benchmarks performance **against target satisfaction levels**.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Open the Power BI file** (`Hospital project.pbix`).  
2. Explore interactive dashboards.  
3. Use **filters & slicers** to analyze specific trends.  
4. Generate insights for decision-making in ER operations.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
- **Patient Demographics** (Age, Gender, Race)
- **Admission Details** (Date, Department Referral, Admission Flag)
- **Experience Metrics** (Wait Time, Satisfaction Score)

## 🔎 Key Findings
- **Peak ER hours result in longer wait times and lower satisfaction.**
- **Certain departments have significantly longer wait times than others.**
- **Satisfaction scores vary widely by department, highlighting inconsistency.**

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization & Analysis)
- **DAX & Power Query** (Data Processing)
- **CSV Data Handling** (Raw Data Transformation)

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add **predictive analytics** to forecast peak ER times.
- Implement **machine learning models** for **wait time prediction**.
- Optimize ER operations using **data-driven staffing decisions**.
